Detection Time: April 25, 2024, 10:15 AM EST.
Detection Method: Automated monitoring systems detected a sudden increase in HTTP 500 errors.
Actions Taken:
•	Investigated frontend code for potential issues.
•	Analyzed server logs for indications of a DDoS attack.
•	Assumed a network issue due to intermittent connectivity reported by users.
Misleading Paths:
•	Initially focused on frontend and network layers without examining backend services.
•	Overlooked database connection pool exhaustion due to lack of visibility into backend service health.
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the backend development team and then to the database administration team.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by increasing the database connection pool size and optimizing database queries to reduce resource consumption.
Root Cause Explanation: A surge in user traffic led to the exhaustion of database connection pools in our microservices architecture, causing cascading failures and rendering the platform unavailable

Resolution Details: The issue was addressed by scaling up the database connection pool size and implementing query optimizations to reduce the database load during peak traffic periods.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvement Areas:
•	Implementing dynamic scaling mechanisms for database connection pools to handle fluctuating traffic loads.
•	Enhancing monitoring and alerting systems to provide real-time visibility into backend service health and performance metrics.
•	Conducting regular performance testing and capacity planning exercises to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
•	Configure auto-scaling policies for database connection pools based on traffic patterns and workload demands.
•	Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions to capture and analyze backend service metrics.
•	Conduct a thorough review of database query performance and optimize frequently executed queries to minimize resource consumption.
